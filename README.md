# 🧪 AI Lab — Projects by Joana Pinto

Hi! I'm Joana — a developer from Portugal building small AI tools that solve real problems.

This repo is where I share experiments, ship useful things, and try to stay consistent. Everything here is built solo, in public, and with the goal of being genuinely helpful.
